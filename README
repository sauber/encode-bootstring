Encode-Bootstring

A general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.

Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values.

This implementation is based on punycode reference implementation from IETFâ€™s RFC3492. Credits to Adam M. Costello for advice and review of implementation.
